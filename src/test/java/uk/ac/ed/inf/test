1 Order Validation Tests
CheckOrderValidation.java
Ensures only valid orders are accepted
Key Scenarios:Invalid card number, expired card, incorrect CVV
Incorrect order total, too many pizzas, Orders from multiple restaurants, restaurant closed

2.Pathfinding Tests
File Name: PathfindingTest.java
Purpose: Ensures A* algorithm computes valid paths
Key Scenarios:Correctly finds shortest path;Avoids no-fly zones;Handles unreachable destinations


3 Performance Tests
 File Name: PerformanceTest.java
Purpose: Ensures route calculation is under 1 second
Key Scenarios:Measures execution time of A* algorithm
Ensures performance scales with large maps

4 Stress Tests
File Name: StressTest.java
Purpose: Ensures system can process 50+ orders efficiently
Key Scenarios:Handles diverse delivery locations Ensures multiple concurrent pathfinding computations

5 Edge Case Tests
File Name: EdgeCaseTest.java
Purpose: Tests rare failure scenarios
Key Scenarios: No valid path exists Sudden GPS failure, Drone unable to reach customer location

 6 Security Tests
File Name: SecurityTest.java
Purpose: Ensures unauthorized drones cannot access restricted areas
Key Scenarios: Unauthorized access attempts fail Only registered drones can process orders

9 CI Pipeline
File Name: .github/workflows/ci.yml
Purpose: Automates building, testing, and deployment simulations
Key Features: Runs all tests automatically on GitHub Actions
Enforces 85% minimum code coverage revents merging if tests fail
